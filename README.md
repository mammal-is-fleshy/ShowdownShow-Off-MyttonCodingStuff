tools and websites i use:
- [EZGIF](https://ezgif.com). (do note that it doesnt (i think) have frame disposing so the layers merge instead of replace, doesnt matter on showdown)
- [Models-Resource](https://www.models-resource.com) (for Ported)
- [Spriters-Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com) (gen 4 and 5 stuff)
- [Textures-Resource](https://www.textures-resource.com) (for some reason, most bw sprites are stored here)
- Krita - drawing stuff
- Blender - everything else
